ECS System: Basic component and entity template setup.
			Basic component manager
			Basic component storage.
			Basic entity manager (needs a little more attention imo)
			Basic general system
			Basic Coordinator class that handles all the managers in one spot
			Basic Event Bus (done. need to test)
			Re-Written Texture class as a c struct
			Basic main class based off of Texture clicker.cpp to actually have a proper insertion point
			Erasure is weird now. Just try it to see what I mean. Need to fix.
			Need to figure out memory management and garbage collection. (stretch goal)


Look into scene graphs for how to make child-parent relationships in scene: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph
Code for engine based off of https://savas.ca/nomad and https://austinmorlan.com/posts/entity_component_system/
