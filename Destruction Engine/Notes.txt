ECS System: Basic component and entity template setup.
			Basic component manager
			Basic component storage.
			Basic entity manager (needs a little more attention imo)
			Basic general system
			Basic Coordinator class that handles all the managers in one spot
			Need to figure out event bus
			Need to make a proper main class based off of Texture clicker.cpp to actually have a proper insertion point
			Need to figure out memory management and garbage collection. (stretch goal)


Look into scene graphs for how to make compound ships and shit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scene_graph
Remember to fix the componentCounter thing in Component.h
